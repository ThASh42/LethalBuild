# Default value: HOARDING BUG\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 0%\n\nScientific name: Linepithema-crassus\nHoarding bugs (of the order Hymenoptera) are large, social insects. While often found living alone, they have been found to share their nests with members of their own species. They measure a height of 3 feet on average, with bulbous bodies. The thinness of their fluid and blood and the material of their carapaces contributes to their low weight, making them capable of flight with their membranous wings. It also makes their bodies somewhat transparent.\n\nHoarding bugs were given their name due to their territorial nature. Once they have chosen a place as their nest, they will seek to adorn it with any object they can find and will protect these objects as a part of the nest. Hoarding bugs are not so dangerous alone as they are in large hives. However, if left alone, hoarding bugs are surprisingly neutral and pose little danger. wWe love the stupid cuddle bugs.!! - tjhis has been a note from the indomitable Sigurd

# Default value: HYGRODERE\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 0%, if you\'re faster than a snail!\n\nScientific name: Hygrodere \nA eukaryotic organism classified within the paraphyletic group Prostita. With the incredible speed of reproduction, these small organisms can multiply to millions. Hygrodere rarely split apart, instead choosing to form large, viscous masses which can take up large amounts of space and become a danger to deal with, requiring large tools or lures to relocate.\n\nHygrodere are drawn to heat and oxygen and can detect it from seemingly anywhere.

# Default value: Thumpers\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 90%\n\nScientific name: Pistris-saevus\nHalves, or Thumpers, are a highly aggressive, carnivorous species of the order Chondrichthyes. Their skeletons are cartilaginous, giving their bodies a stretchy and rubbery quality. They must eat their bottom legs in order to escape the shell of their hatched egg; their bottom legs are hardly functional to begin with. Their arms, or front legs, are very strong, and they occasionally use them to stomp prey. They can reach great speeds in a straight line.\n\nThey are relentless hunters, typically at the top of their food chain. Their main weaknesses are their intelligence and complete lack of hearing. If you come across a thumper, your best means of survival are leaving its line of sight, as it is slower around corners and can\'t easily track prey.\n\nDue to the fast and volatile evolution of this species, some theorize that thumpers are one of the examples of an increased number of mutations causing higher levels of speciation in planets around the Thistle Nebula.

# Default value: EYELESS DOG\n\nScientific name: Leo caecus\nA large mammal of the class Saeptivus. They are social, hunting in very large packs. They have also been called \"breathing lions\" for their recognizable sound and large mouths. They are endurance hunters and attempt to make up for their lack of sight with their sense of hearing. It\'s a popular myth that they often mistake the sounds of their own kind for prey, entering fights within their own packs.\n\nTheir behaviour is unique from other pack animals in their tendency to spread out far to cover distance. When an eyeless dog has found prey, it roars to alert others in the near vicinity, who will also sound the alarm, sometimes resulting in a kind of chain reaction. Eyeless dogs can be dangerous in swarms. However, they are characteristically clumsy, taking guesses at their prey\'s exact location which are often incorrect.

# Default value: Tulip Snakes\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 1%\n\nScientific name: Draco tulipa\nTulip snakes, or tulip lizards, are a type of flying lizard which are easily distinguished by their long arms and wings, which can reach twice the size of other members of their genus (Draco) and sport unusually bright colors and patterns. Their name comes from the flaps under their neck and behind their head, which resemble large flower petals. (Their other unusual characteristics include an extra pair of eyes and a deeply forked tail.)\n\nTheir behaviour is stubborn and fearless to a fault. Indeed, tulip snakes will rarely flee a predator. But ironically, many biologists theorize that their flowery appearance aids them more as a camoflauge than an intimidation display. It also takes an important part in their elaborate courtship rituals, which are more similar to that of birds. \n\nUniquely, lifting heavy and large objects into the air has often been observed as a part of the tulip snake\'s mating display; they are capable of carrying rocks and plants at least twice their size in an effort to impress their potential mate. Protective, jealous, and in a frenzy, the males may end up in tug-of-war fights over objects they take a liking to, which can even include other living creatures.

# Default value: Kidnapper fox\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 80% GOOD JOB he gets an A+ in creep schcool\n\nScientific name: Vulpes raptor\nA large mammal of the family Canidae, the Kidnapper fox has many unique biological traits. Two of these are its horizontal jaw and unique skull shape giving it a great biting strength, and its long, frog-like tongue which can reach even twice the length of its spindly body. They are solitary hunters and mate for life.\n\nKidnapper foxes have a very long, bushy neck and tail with a more reddish coloration, which is thought to blend in well with the numerous Vain Shroud, where it can almost always be found hiding and waiting for prey. The Kidnapper fox and Vain shrouds together form one of the most infamously known and unique mutualistic relationships between two invasive species. Together they continue to spread across planetary systems, stowing away on large spacecraft. Excluding a select few nature preserves, the ITDA has issued a kill-on-sight order for the Kidnapper fox and Vain shrouds due to their impact on ecosystems. \n\nThe Kidnapper fox earns its name from its aggressive yet timid and territorial behaviour, preferring to finish off prey out of sight and usually in the comfort of the Vain shrouds. It usually chooses to lie low and wait for things to come its way. But if it grows restless, it can use its long, sticky tongue to snatch its prey from great distances and drag them as far as it needs. If there are Vain shrouds in your area, carry a weapon and do not stray far from others; its tongue is quite soft and fragile and can be struck easily, forcing it to stop an assault. Today there are relatively few human deaths attributed to Kidnapper foxes per year, and most victims are unsupervised children or adults hiking alone.\n\n\n

It was first nicknamed by workers of the Caswella Mine, one of many copper mines along the asteroid belt of Lepus, in 1951. The Caswella Mine had begun to languish since the end of wartime and would soon close after operating for twelve years; working conditions had worsened long before the rumor of the Maneater had begun to spread, and as a result, it was not taken seriously by the higher ups or media at the time. On June 23 of that year, however, an eviscerated corpse was rescued from the lowest level of Caswella Mine. \n\nIt was later identified as Brett Goldent, a senior mining operator. Autopsy recorded the death an accident resulting from faulty equipment. However the story became a sensation, and the Maneater rose up as a famous myth until six years later, when it would be first recorded in the DEEP57 cave expedition headed by Simon Goldent to put to rest the mystery of his father\'s death. This was a revelation to the scientific world, as it is now known as the largest troglobite (cave-dwelling species). A creature of this size confined to underground caves was thought impossible. Simon Goldent, who had seeked to disprove the myth, described his discovery as \"traumatic.\"\n\nPeriplaneta clamorus is thought to live off of mainly plant debri and animal carcasses, both of which can be carried into the caves by running water. It seems to have never developed the instinctive fear of larger predators while living underground. Thus, as a larva it may be fascinated or indifferent to human presence. However, as larvae, they can react fearfully to loud noises or to the sight of blood and injury. Some researchers have observed the larvae to show signs of loneliness.\n\nBeing unhappy or afraid seems to exacerbate Periplaneta clamorus\' symptoms of growth. Its metamorphosis is remarkably sudden and is a dangerous phenomenon to observe. The most telling sign that a larva is approaching metamorphosis is an excretion of an acidic, foamy liquid at its lower jaw; this substance is believed to be a catalyst and exits its body in large quantities once metamorphosis begins.\n\nAn adult can move incredibly fast and is capable of creating loud noise by clicking its mandibles at high frequency. In an encounter with Periplaneta clamorus, recommended procedure is to back away slowly and keep your distance, as it seems to wait for you to approach and avoids line of sight. Stopping and exhaling suddenly while arching its legs backwards is a sign that an adult is entering chase. God help[ you\n\n\n\n
